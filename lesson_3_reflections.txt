When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when you are working with other people and have to share code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  You may want to pull them manually if you want to make sure that each change is logical an your not over commiting.
