Reflections Lesson 1

(5-4) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It showed a + - of what is missing / the differences in the code. 

(5-4) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can understand what has worked and what you have changed. Also being able to bring forth code instead of re writing it. 

(5-7) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Cons:there would be problems with forgeting to save and then losing code
cons: its time consuming
Pros: Saving when you have pertenate information to save and its needed in a commit. 
Pros:  Not saving when its errelvant or having tons of saves

(5-7) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because these documents can be interconnected and they aren't like a google doc that stands on its own and doesnt share anything with the other file 

(5-9) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files? 

Git log shows a list of all the commits file and a git diff shows what occurred between 2 commits and what has changed.

(5-9) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because you can simply go back to the prior commit and work through it. 

(5-9) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
